## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, BootStrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

I built this full-stack website with the idea of creating a site where local amateur soccer players can meet anywhere and play whenever. Soccer is one of my favorite sports, and have always find it hard to find people to play with. 

## Optimizations

Needed optimizations: 
- Make event form responsive
- Add map to event finder page
- Add another layer of security to event sign up
- Attend button can only be clicked once per user
- Implement Event calendar: Allow users to view upcoming meetups and RSVP for them.
- Implement Location mapping: Show the location of the meetups on a map, making it easier for users to find their way to the venue.
- Allow users to create profiles, including information such as their skill level, favorite team, and positions they play. This can help users find others with similar interests to play with.
- Implement internal marketplace where users can buy, sell, and trade soccer equipment through the website.
- Create forums where users can discuss soccer-related topics, share tips and advice, and connect with other fans.
