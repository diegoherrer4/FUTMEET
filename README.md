# FUTMEET
Soccer Meetup Website with Auth

**Link to project:** https://futmeet.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, BootStrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

I built this full-stack website with the idea of creating a site where local amateur soccer players can meet anywhere and play whenever. Soccer is one of my favorite sports, and have always find it hard to find people to play with. 

## Optimizations

Needed optimizations: 
- Make event form responsive
- Add map to event finder page
- Add another layer of security to event sign up

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
